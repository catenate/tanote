[[~normul-postem]]: [[~sarlev-sarsen]], I'm still happy to work on [[%pony]]! But I still need a more experienced [[Hoon]] dev.

[[~hatryx-lastud]]: [[%pony]] sounds possibly cool though my feedback would be that email is arguably the least broken and crappy thing in all of normie computing today, so I wonder about the utility of an [[urbit app]] that competes with [[email]].

[[~ponhec-picwen]]: [[~hatryx-lastud]], but email is centralised, and no-one routes email from host to host with [[sendmail]] anymore in a [[distributed network]], because it takes the resources of a [[Google]] to catch [[spam]], because [[identity]] is free on the [[internet]].

[[~sarlev-sarsen]]: Iâ€™d make the case (as the one pushing this as something we need on Urbit) that the unbroken nature of e-mail as being on of the things most needed to be cloned over to Urbit.  Threaded conversations which can add and remove participants during any part of the conversation by any participant and the ability to manage multiple conversations with the same person or set of people is tremendously useful.

[[~ponhec-picwen]]: I plan something like this in %tanote: every time each note changes it creates a new version, which may be sent to a different group of people.
