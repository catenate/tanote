![[crop_tanote.png]]

Small PNG from drawshield. Three stacked horizontal sections.  Top: vert, hash sable. Middle: or, bar sable.  Bottom: celestial azure, v sable.  Alternately, arrow fletched facing downward sable.

Crop to remove bottom section.

Color picker says the code for the bottom section is 4cf9ff.  This apparently doesn't quite match, or landscape does something to the bubble around the name to make it slightly lighter.

## blazon
