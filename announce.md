[[~nocsyx-lassul]]: we keep hoping someone will build one

[[~ponhec-picwen]]: [[~nocsyx-lassul]], I recently had a brainstorm, and have been inspired to make something that strikes me as Martian.  I just started Hoon school (I'm up to recursion), and then comes Gall school and working through the journal example.  I'm doing this on my own, but I have a Computer Engineering degree and 40 years experience writing software (taught myself BASIC on a TI-99/4A and Logo on a Commodore 64), so I should be able to figure it out.  Here's my work on it so far, which is mostly just notes and a static page.

Speaking of early days of home computers, Urbit most reminds me of the shareware and freeware produced by communities of hobbyists and spread by word-of-mouth, swap meets, BBSes, small-group zines, and ads in the back pages of magazines from which you typed in program listings.  It's nice to get back to that spirit and enthusiasm, in which random people use what they know to make software they love.

[[~ponhec-picwen]]: [[~pinsyt-nossub]], I read that, but what I'd like to build is not that. It's not a mediated common view that tries to reconcile multiple simultaneous edits. It's more like email, in that you send asynchronously a particular version of a titled document, but the new (ur-)bit is that it stores and presents together, as versions in a series, all the notes with the same title, since it considers these drafts of the same document, working towards a definition of that title. Which document titles you may select from, to view, is determined by the active selected hash tags, and the list of hash tags to select from is composed from the list of hash tags in the latest versions of all the documents (plus a * to see every note, plus the note's faction, plus the @p of the note's author, plus the @p of each recipient). Each version of each note has a list of people (by @p) to whom it is sent, and once sent it appears in that person's set of notes (I'm not really yet planning on delete, but you can always make a new blank version of a note with any title to remove it from the hashtag index). I'm also planning on signalling which other visible notes have back links to the current note (though Urbsidian is also not quite what I want to write), and allowing the writer of the note to provide with each note a tag stating the note's single factional point of view (cf Uberfact), to keep the notes small and focused and coherent and findable.
