This series is designed to teach you Hoon without assuming you have an extensive programming background.  In fact, you should be able to follow much of it even if you have no programming experience at all, though of course experience helps.  We strongly encourage you to try out all the examples of each lesson.  These lessons are meant for the beginner, but they aren't meant to be skimmed.  Each lesson falls into one of two categories: **readings**, which are prose-heavy explanations of Hoon fundamentals, and **walkthroughs**, which are line-by-line explanations of example programs.  Walkthroughs are found between readings, offering a practical implementation of the concepts taught in the reading before.

This guide will walk through everything you need to know to write your own Gall agents.  The Gall Guide is suitable for anyone with an intermediate knowledge of Hoon.  If you've worked through [Hoon School](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/hoon-school/intro) or something equivalent, you should be fine.

This series walks through the writing of a full Gall agent, and then the process of integrating it with a React front-end. This series follows on from the previous [Gall Guide](https://urbit.org/docs/userspace/gall-guide/intro). If you haven't completed that, or otherwise aren't familiar with the basics of writing Gall agents, it's strongly recommended to work through that guide first.
