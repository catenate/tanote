[[~monsut-bidnym]]: [[~tonned-fampet]], I think [[knowledge management]] on [[Urbit]] is a big project, but could encompass all of these things.  [[Holium]] is making a bid at this with [[Engram]].

[[~tonned-fampet]]: [[~monsut-bidnym]], this has probably been said before, but a feature that would be really nice for [[Engram]] is [[bi-directional linking]], similar to [[Roam Research]] and [[Obsidian]].  My wife is a heavy user of Roam; although she has an [[Urbit planet]] that I gave her but rarely uses it.  She has said that if there were a Roam competitor on Urbit she would actually use the platform.

If her view is any indication, a Roam competitor on Urbit could be a killer app that could drive more mainstream adoption of Urbit, much more so than a reproduction of [[Google Docs]] or whatever. Google Docs is free, and so it will only be true Urbit believers already on the platform that would be interested in using an Urbit-based competitor to a Google product. But Roam Research costs about $15 a month, and so Roam users would have a strong financial incentive to take the time to set up a personal server to run an Urbit-based Roam competitor if it means eliminating lock-in to an expensive [[SaaS]] offering. An Urbit-based Roam competitor would also hit the right sweet spot of decentralization. If you don't want to pay for Roam Research, your best option is to use Obsidian, in which case you are stuck using a knowledge graph tied to your PC.

[[~ponhec-picwen]]: I use Obsidian synced between my laptop and phone, so if one crashes the other can resync the replacement. I plan to have [[bi-directional linking]] in %[[tanote/tanote]], but I'm still working on internals, like structuring notes into histories and histories into stores, and extracting tags and back links from stores, to have the right displays on the front end. Also, I have no real plans to make an "[[Urbsidian]]": if we liken [[Emacs]] to [[Obsidian]], then what I want to create with %[[tanote]] is more like [[vi]] (or [[vim]]).

I should also mention that I feel %[[tanote]] will be better at sharing than any of the mentioned tools, since it will be able to share (and record the fact of that sharing) specific versions of specific notes individually. Also, if it works out, my plan is to let you optionally gate the sharing on whether the recipient(s) have a specific [[gora]] that you can set per version of a note.
