Tags at top: set of tags. bold if selected for display filter (clicked). italic if tagged by currently selected note (in text of note after `#`).  list of @p are pulled from %pals, or ride with notes shared by others to you (*id est*, you are named as a reader).  bold @p for author of current version of note.  italic @p for readers of current version of note.  `*` displays all notes.  `/` displays all notes with backlinks to the currently selected note.  update when a version is added: when a local version is saved, when a note is shared (which also saves it), or when a version of a note is received.  ~~each tag needs to store a list of notes which referred to it in any version.~~

Notes in middle: set of notes which match the tags selected for display filter.  selected note (clicked) is bold.  click on a note to switch to it.  italic notes are those which still refer to the current note with a `[[]]` reference (backlink).  updated when a version is added.  ~~each note needs to maintain a list of other notes which referred to it in any version, and check whether the latest version still does.~~

Text versions at bottom: current note text, sharing tools.  title is first line.  list of authors that changed the text in second line.  text in `[[]]` is taken to be other notes.  text from `#` to space is taken to be a tag.

*by* (read-only) is the writer of this version of the note.  Change to self when the note is edited.

_as_ is the name of the faction (_confer_ [[Yarvin 2007]]) of the point of view of the note.

*to* is the set of readers (exclude writers) to which this is shared.  Share the current note when someone is named as a reader, and the author clicks *to* (or moves to a different line).

*re* is the title of the note. update title in list of notes when this is clicked (or when the author moves to a different line), which locally saves a version.

*no* is a serial count of the version saved when this is clicked, and *of* is the highest version known.  when a new version is received, increment *of* (read-only).  if an existing version is entered and this is clicked, present that version.  if a version that does not yet exist is entered and this is clicked, save the text as that version.  when a note is selected, display the highest version known.  not everyone's correspondences between version number and text will be the same, since they may edit without sharing, may be added later, and may receive versions in different orders.
