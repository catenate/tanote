## Summary

A line-based editor for looking at text and code.  Can be organized by projects.  Allows multiple people to edit, but can use locking for now.

Could store edits as diffs.  Graph-store is probably fine for this, but a native storage format could work as well and would be good to think through tradeoffs.  Interesting extensions would be things like line annotations.

This project is a good introduction to social apps in Urbit, and could become the framework for a larger product if the apprenticeship prototype works.
