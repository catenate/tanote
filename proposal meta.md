[[~sarlev-sarsen]]: Some reason I can’t join this group, but if you are interested in making this a serious project, submit it at [https://Urbit.org/grants/proposals](https://urbit.org/grants/proposals) and we can see about getting some address space into your hands if you succeed in building something useful.

Good proposals all include the following:

-   A **detailed and clear description of the proposal**. If you're proposing something technical, user stories are a good idea.
-   An overview of **why you are the right person for the job**. A description of your background, familiarity with the project, and professional/education experience are all good starts.
-   Your estimate for **date of completion**.
-   The **amount of funding** you'd like for the project, denominated in stars.
-   What **specific deliverables** will look like.

It's recommended to break your project into _milestones_, each of which must have its own completion dates, funding amounts and deliverables. In general, proposals should target a first deliverable within two months of the start of the project. Proposals should have a maximum of five milestones as scoping a project beyond that is impractical, and each milestone should constitute significant enough work to warrant the reward of a full star.
