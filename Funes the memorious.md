_ut nihil non iisdem verbis redderetur auditurn_: that nothing should be rendered without the same words (Google translate)

"I have more memories in myself alone than all men have had since the world was a world."

"My dreams are like your vigils."

"My memory, sir, is like a garbage disposal."

The truth is that we all live by leaving behind; no doubt we all profoundly know that we are immortal and that sooner or later every man will do all things and know everything.

He had not written it down, for what he once meditated would not be erased.

The two projects I have indicated (an infinite vocabulary for the natural series of numbers, and a usable mental catalogue of all the images of memory) are lacking in sense, but they reveal a certain stammering greatness.  They allow us to make out dimly, or to infer, the dizzying world of Funes.  He was, let us not forget, almost incapable of general, platonic ideas.

Funes could continuously make out the tranquil advances of corruption, of caries, of fatigue.  He noted the progress of death, of moisture.  He was the solitary and lucid spectator of a multiform world which was instantaneously and almost intolerably exact. 

I suspect, nevertheless, that he was not very capable of thought.  To think is to forget a difference, to generalize, to abstract.  In the overly replete world of Funes there were nothing but details, almost contiguous details.
