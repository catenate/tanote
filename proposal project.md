# Tanote proposal

## Project summary

### Qualifications

I recently had a brainstorm that defined this project, and have been inspired to make something that strikes me as Martian.  I'm doing this on my own, but I have a Computer Engineering degree and 40 years experience writing software (taught myself BASIC on a TI-99/4A and Logo on a Commodore 64), so I should be able to figure it out.  Professionally, I’ve been a software build engineer since 1994, in telecoms, build-tool, financial, and electrical-distribution industries, and I use Inferno over top of whichever laptop OS they give me.

### Funding

I’ll let the Foundation decide how much this project is worth.  I hope at least one star, which I would use to get more people into Urbit.
