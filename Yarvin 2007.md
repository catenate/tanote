Notice these group labels.  In Uberfact, these are called _factions_.  Factions are groups of people who see the world in the same way.  Factions may form on any issue and for any reason—progressive _versus_ conservative, Ford _versus_ Chevy, [emacs _versus_ vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war).

Any user can have a reputation in as many factions as he likes.  But reputation in one faction has no meaning to another faction.  To a Ford-lover, it means nothing that you’re a highly rated libertarian.  What do you know about limited-slip differentials?  Jack.  Until you prove otherwise.

Every contribution to Uberfact must be associated with a faction, and it is judged by that faction and that faction only.  If the contribution is good, it improves your local reputation within that faction.  If I have something to share about Ezra Pound, I have to decide whether I’m saying it as a modernist, a postmodernist, a New Critic, _et cetera_, _et cetera_.

Factions are self-constituting—they are responsible for their own reputation algorithms.  Anyone can start a new faction for any reason, but generally they form by the usual process of human group formation—one group gets too large and quarrelsome, and splits into parts.  The faction’s founders constitute and manage its reputation system.

For example, early in Uberfact’s development, there would probably be a libertarian faction.  This would then fragment into Rothbardian, Randian, and Kochian libertarians—at least.  Various strongly-flavored personalities might spin off their own little factions, and so on.

As a user of Uberfact, you have access to all content produced by all factions.  Your process for answering a question, such as “is George W Bush a tyrant,” is in two steps.  One, figure out what faction is both (a) interested in this question, and (b) reasonably aligned with your own perspective in the area.  Two, find out what that faction says about George W Bush.

For example, it’s easy to imagine upgrading Wikipedia to be uberfactious.  Instead of one page for George W Bush, you could read the story of George W Bush according to libertarians, according to progressives, according to jihadis, racists, Ford lovers, emacs bigots, and so on—anyone who cares enough to have an opinion about George W Bush.

One might quickly notice that these pages matched in certain details.  For example, jihadis, racists, and progressives probably all agree that George W Bush was born on July 6, 1946.  So all of these groups might contribute to a consensus page, signed by a large number of factions, which might even be similar to today’s “objective” page.  And since this would probably be the most commonly requested George W. Bush page, it would come up first.  An uberfactious Wikipedia doesn’t need to be any harder to use than today’s neutralist Wikipedia.
