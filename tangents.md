[[~fabled-faster]].  month _circa_ [[2021-10]].  Mass proliferation of writing/[[Roam]]-like apps.  [[urbit group]]s: [[Foundation grant]] ideas.   web+urbitgraph://group/~wolref-podlex/foundation/graph/~wolref-podlex/grant-ideas/170141184505228879328373638614380183552

[[Roam]] and [[Notion]] are onto something.  It’s important to be able to go beyond writing and into the realm of creating interconnected graphs of nodes that you can share with others across the network.  There could be great overlap between writing, ‘groups’ (new landscape) and a knowledge graph or roamlike.

...

~wicrum-wicrun: Could I later edit the node in the knowledge graph (_eg_ add links to other nodes, or just rephrase it)?  Without affecting the original chat message?  While still keeping the "forked from"-link to the original chat message (and vice versa)?

[[~datryn-ribdun]]: Would be cool to make an easily deployable [[gora]] for new app users. Like "I just made %dongers, and some people have installed it. I want to send all of them gorae to thank them".  Easy to do if you have a list, but not sure how you'd get the list automatically. somewhere software distribution must store the [[@p]]s that have installed from the developer's desk, you just have to extract it.

[[~noddep-hanwep]]: Is there some nice way of having long discussions on very specific topics on Urbit?

[[~ravmel-ropdyl]]: We use notebooks for this from time to time, but it's not ideal.

[[~noddep-hanwep]]: I mean the kind of stuff that belongs in a forum thread rather than a chat

[[~ravmel-ropdyl]]: Yeah, notebooks are the stand in for this.
