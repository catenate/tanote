# tanote

Tanote (tah-noh-tay) is a community knowledge manager for [Urbit](https://urbit.org/docs/development/develop), which uses tags to present subsets of notes, and sends specific versions of notes to others.

I'm currently working through [Hoon School](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/hoon-school), so this project will be in development for a while, as I figure out how to write it.

The markdown files in this repository are best viewed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
