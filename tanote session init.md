[[tanote screen layout]]

The starting screen, before adding any version.  The list of @ps comes from %pals.  `|` represents the cursor at the start of a text entry field.  Struck-out text is changeable.  Highlighted text is clickable.  Your own id is italic because itâ€™s in the text of the note.  The star should be bold, since it is selected by default, and highlighted, since it is clickable.
